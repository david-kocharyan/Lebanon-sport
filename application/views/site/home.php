					The Cleveland Browns got a big win on Sunday by going into Baltimore and knocking off Lamar Jackson and the Ravens 40-25. The W moves Cleveland to 2-2 and atop the AFC North. More importantly though, this Browns team finally gave us the performance that we’ve been waiting for pretty much all offseason long.

				<p>
					Early in the season, we’ve seen Cleveland’s offense look out of sync, Baker Mayfield try to force throws when he didn’t need to, and a ton of costly mistakes from the Browns.
				</p>
				<p>
					With just one win over the Jets on the season, the Browns had a big test in front of them against the defending division champs, and they passed with flying colors. After being tied with Baltimore at 10-all early in the third quarter, Cleveland scored another 30 points to put the game on ice.
